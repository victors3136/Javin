# Description and Disclaimer
The interpreter represents a semester-long project during the Advanced Programming Methods course taught by Professor Florin Craciun.  
The parser is a personal project which I do without any guidance, so it may not always be fully operational. If that is the case, the interpreter can still work if it has an explicit ProgramState constructor passed into it.  
Content is subject to change and is bug prone due to the bi-weekly additions of new requirements.  
Should be in a fully functional state by February 2024, after the end of the semester.  
  
*Current functionalities fully available:*  
 - Arithmetic computations (+,-,*,/,^)  
 - Reading input from files (fopen, fread, fclose)  
 - Conditional Statements (if)  
 - Repetitive Statements (while)  
 - Variable Scoping (while(1)(int i) will not yield an error :) )  
 - Heap Management and Garbage Collection (heap_alloc, heap_write, heap_read)  
 - Concurrency (fork)  
 - Typechecking (done at parsing rather than at runtime)  
 - GUI using JavaFX (add, edit, execute and even debug code in a GUI)
