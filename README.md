# Description and Disclaimer
The interpreter represents a semester-long project during the Advanced Programminng Methods course taught by Professor Florin Craciun.  
The parser is a personal project which I do without any guidance, so it may not always be fully operational. If that is the case, the interpreter can still work if it has an explicit ProgramState constructor passed into it.  
Content is subject to change and is bug prone due to the often addition of new requirements.  
Should be in a fully functional state by February 2024, after the end of the semester.
